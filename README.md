Libre Greek -- Libre Office extension
=====================================

This is an effort to gather the best support material for the
Greek language the Greek FOSS community has produced so far into
a single Libre Office extension.

I 'm starting with:

      * The combined English/Greek dictionary from the Firefox
        extension of Kostas Papadimas

      * Thesaurus from OpenThesaurus.gr (now defunkt) from 2006

      * Hyphenation rules for Greek by InterZone

      * The OpenOffice templates that were translated to Greek
        during Greek Coding Camp 2009.

And the hope is to continue with more material like grammar
correction etc etc.

Although credit for the content goes to the respective authors,
the packaging is done by me, Pantelis Koukousoulas and the
Squibby Linux Team and we take full responsibility for it,
so please forward any issues / complaints to us.
